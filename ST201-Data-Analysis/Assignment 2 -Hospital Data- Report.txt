The sample size is 200 patients. We wish to see how well these hospitals have cured these patients when they have less severe and more severe cases. Regardless of severity, 100 patients went to H1 and 100 patients went to H2.
The data I have gained can be seen on the R file I have sent along with this document. When analysising the data, we can see the relationships the hospitals have with each other, the success and failure rate and success and failure rate while looking at the severity of the cases.
When the severity is less, The sample size for H1 is 20 and sample size for H2 is 80. For H1, there are 2 failures, meaning the failure rate is 10%. For H2, there are 16 failures, meaning that the failure rate is 20%. Together, this means when the patients are in a less severe condition, there is a failure rate of 18%. The failure rate for H2 is double that of H1.
When the severity is more, The sample size for H1 is 80 and sample size for H2 is 20. For H1, there are 48 failures, meaning the failure rate is 60% for H1. For H2, there are 16 failures, meaning the failure rate is 80%. Together, this means when the patients are in a more severe condition, there is a failure rate of 64%. The failure rate for H2 is 20% more than that of H1.
Regardless of severity, The failure rate for H1 is 50%. The failure rate for H2 is 32%. There is an overall failure rate of 41%. There is an 18% higher success rate in H2 than there is in H1.
In the Chi squared test, be can see that X-squared is 5.9735 with a df = 1 and p-value =  0.01452. A Chi-squared test is used for testing dependence between hospital choice and outcome with interpretation. The further away X-squared is from 0, the less likely it is that the variables are independent. 5.9735 isn't too far from 0, but we use the p-value to make the decision.  A p-value less than 0.05 would mean a very small % and leads us to reject the null hypothesis. This p-value is 0.01452, which means that we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that Hospital and success rate are independent.
An Odds Ratio is defined as having two categories of success, the odds are: Success/failure in category 1 & Success/failure in category 2. There are 2 odds ratios. One for a 2-way table to do with the hospital and outcome, and a 3-way table for the severity. 
For the 2-way table, the odds for H1 is 50%/50% = 1. For H2, the odds are 68%/32% = 2.125. This means the odds ratio for Hospital and outcome is 2.125.
While looking at the logg odds ratios for hospital and outcome by severity, we can see for less it is -0.819302 and for more, it is -0.9708293.
An association within different groups can reverse direction when the data are combined to form a single group. This reversal is called Simpson's paradox. 
In this example it occurs due to factors not taken into account. It doesn't take into account the age of the patients, as elderly people could be more suspectable to failing the tratment than young adults due to having a weaker immune system.
From this analysis, I can conclude that the overall treatment in Hospital 2 is better than Hospital 1. If my case was severe, I would definitely go to hospital 2. However, if I had a less severe case, I would go to hospital 1 as their failure rate is lower when it comes to less severe cases.
